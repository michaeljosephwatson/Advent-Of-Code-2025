### Advent of Code

I thought it would be fun to do Advent of Code this year (2025) and thought it would be nice to upload them here.

There are 12 problems this year. 

I will also add problems from other years as I have found this experience enjoyable.

My aim is to improve my problem solving skills and come up with some nice solutions by myself.

The problems can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com).

Full credit and gratitude goes to the team behind this fun festive activity.
